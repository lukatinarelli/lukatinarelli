# Hi I'm Luka ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Network Systems Administration (ASIR) student** passionate about technology and always eager to learn. My studies focus on **operating systems**, **networking**, **virtualization**, and databases.

Previously, I completed a Technological Baccalaureate, excelling in Programming and Data Processing. During that time, I participated in the Informatics Olympiad, an experience that strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my love for IT.

I'm driven to grow in network administration and cybersecurity, aiming to contribute to innovative and impactful projects in the tech world.
