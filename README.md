# Hi, I'm Luka ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about technology and always eager to learn new things. I recently finished my studies in Network Systems Administration (ASIR) and right now I'm doing my internship at a cloud company, where I'm getting hands-on experience with cloud platforms and automation tools.

Previously, I completed a Technological Baccalaureate, focusing on Programming and Data Processing. I also participated in the Informatics Olympiad, which was a great opportunity to challenge myself and learn from others.

I'm excited to keep growing in network administration and cybersecurity, and I hope to contribute to innovative projects in the tech world.
